Notes for Thinking In Java(4th) by Bruce Eckel

Not every Java Developer, especially who is switching or switched from other fields/professions, have read the book Thinking In Java words by words. However, I bet, the best ones do.

Here is my plan: 50 pages a day, finish it in one month.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Day</th>
    <th>Pages</th>
    <th>Hard</th>
    <th>Notes</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>00</td>
    <td>0 - 60</td>
    <td>**</td>
    <td>skip jsp and applet</td>
  </tr>
  </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>01</td>
    <td>61 - 92</td>
    <td>**</td>
    <td>passing object reference by value. practically skip "static import" ?</td>
  </tr>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>02</td>
    <td>93 - 154</td>
    <td>*</td>
    <td>boolean is special. switch is updated in Java7</td>
  </tr>
</table>
