# PracticeCodesForThinkingInJava4th
Practice codes for Thinking In Java(4th) by Bruce Eckel

Not every Java Developer, especially who is switching or switched from other fields/professions, have read the book Thinking In Java words by words. However, I bet, the best ones do.

Here is my plan: 50 pages a day, finish it in one month.

Day | Pages | Hard | Notes
00 | 0 - 60 | ** | skip jsp and applet
01 | 61 - 92 | ** | passing object reference by value. practically skip "static import" ?
02 | 93 - 154 | * | boolean is special. switch updated in Java7
